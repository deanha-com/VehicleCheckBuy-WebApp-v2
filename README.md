# Vehicle. Check. Buy. v.2.0

A responsive web app ideally made for mobile devices.

This is an addition version from my original idea of the [Car Check v1](https://github.com/deanha-com/CarCheck-v1)

A simple app that uses iframe to load the websites that allows you to do vehicle and MOT history checks.

Its extreamely useful if you are looking to buy a used car.

####Features
* basic car info
* car MOT status
* car TAX status
* MOT History

#### Pending features
* pre-purchase tips page - guiding you on what you should check for before going ahead with your purchase. 
* bargaining tips - info on how you can get the price down, even just a little bit.

This web-app was build upon the Google Nexus Website Menu which is available
[here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/30/google-nexus-website-menu/).

The reason I have chosen to use this is because it has a very mobile app feel to it. The off-canvas navigation works very well.
